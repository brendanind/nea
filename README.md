This is the repo for all the NEA related code that I will be making for my A-level project

The idea is to have a camera server (raspi?) monitoring a 3D printing setup to detect print bed adhesion faluire using opencv tracking and other algorithms.

Could possibly incorperate some machine learning somewhere down the line too.

Liscencesssss.......?? Have no clue.
